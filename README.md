# SAP-Business-Process

This course introduces the student to how integrated business processes are managed using enterprise resource
planning (ERP) systems. Many large organizations use ERP systems to drive business processes, collect data, and
share information across all areas of the business. The world’s largest ERP system provider is SAP. In this course,
students will use the latest SAP software to examine how various chains of business tasks or activities are managed,
with particular attention paid to how these activities span across functional areas of the business. Students will
develop an understanding of the many chains of interrelated events that must occur for any business to successfully
serve its internal and external customers. Using SAP, students will execute tasks for a fictitious business, carrying
out activities related to sales order processing, procurement, material requirements planning, production planning, and
forecasting. Upon completion of this course, students will have developed a high-level view of the chain of information
“hand offs” that occur among and between functional areas of the business, and how the use of an ERP system can
contribute to organizational efficiency.
